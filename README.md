## FusionAuth Localization ![semver 2.0.0 compliant](http://img.shields.io/badge/semver-2.0.0-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)

If you're using FusionAuth and your first language is not English, we can use your help! We are shipping support for localized login pages and while our users can localize themselves, we would like to provide a base of languages to use when building out your theme or localization strategy.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit a PR or open an issue so we can discuss how you can help!

## How to translate

For languages listed in the wanted section, start with the `theme/message.properties` as a base, and rename it by adding a country code suffix. The wanted section outlines the country code and filename per language. If the language you are translating is not listed there simply find your two character country code and append it to follow the pattern below.

If there is already a `theme/message_xx.properties` file for your language you will find a `missing-translations/message_xx.properties` file that lists only those messages that are missing from the base theme. Use this file to find the missing messages and add them to the base theme file for you language. You don't have to add new messages in any particular place, you can add them to the bottom and once finished you can run the `update.rb` ruby script (or we can run it for you) to reorganize the base `/theme` file and update the `/missing-translations` file.

It is not required that you translate every message, when a message is not translated FusionAuth will fall back to the default message in the theme. This is generally English unless you have modified the default messages in your theme.

As FusionAuth adds new messages they will not (currently) be automatically added to any of these translated files. This means these messages will only be displayed in English until translated. As mentioned you can find missing translations in the `/missing-translations` files.

## Wanted
This is just a suggested list, please contribute whatever you can! We're happy to pay you for your efforts, if you can contribute a new quality translation we can send you $50 as a token of our appreciation, join the [forum](https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/) and let us know so we can send a gift your way.

### Project Layout

The theme folder contains translations that can be used in a FusionAuth theme. The missing translations folder contains a list of messages that are in the `message.properties` file (English) that are missing from the language indicated by the country code suffix (e.g. `_it` for Italian).

## How to use a translation

First, find the language translation you want.

* Clone this project. 
* Copy the contents of one of the message properties files.

Next, update your theme.

* Log in to the FusionAuth administrative user interface.
* If you only have the default theme, make a copy. The default theme is immutable.
* Edit your theme. 
* Navigate to the "Messages" tab.
* Select "Add localization"
* Set the "Locale" to the language.
* Paste in the contents of the messages properties file.
* Click "Submit"
* Click the blue save icon to save the theme.
* Update your tenant to use the new theme.

Test it out:

* Navigate to your FusionAuth instance and [provide a locale in one of the supported manners](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/localization-and-internationalization/#hosted-login-pages).

Not all translations are up to date. Where there are missing messages, the default English text will be displayed. Please contribute any fixes or additional translations for missing messages.
